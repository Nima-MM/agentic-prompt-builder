# UI/UX Specification (Frontend Blueprint)

**Purpose:** This document is the bridge between the Human CTO's visual ideas (sketches, images) and the AI Frontend Worker's code execution. It translates aesthetic intent into strict `shadcn/ui` and `Tailwind` dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> The CTO Consultant parses images provided in the chat and writes the machine-readable specifications here. The Orchestrator MUST force the Frontend Worker to read this file before generating React components.
